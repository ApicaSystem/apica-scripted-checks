# Run Anything Example Java Project

You may reuse the src/main/java/com/apicasystems/metricsdemo/model/JsonResult class for easy integration into your own projects (check pom.xml for dependencies).


## If you want to run the sample
Build the example executable jar by running

```bash
mvn clean package
```

You may then test your jar by running

```bash
java -jar ./demo-metrics-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Or just download the demo-driver.jar file.
